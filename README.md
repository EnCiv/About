# About
[EnCiv](http://enciv.org) Is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to making democracy work better online. 

If you would like to get involved, join the [slack](enciv.slack.com) workspace.  We have regular meeting online on Wedensday's at 6:30pm Pacific Time.  See the slack channel for announcments and links.

We have several active projects:
- **[Undebate](https://github.com/EnCiv/undebate)**- How do you engage candidates in 1000’s of elections, in productive Q&A so voters can quickly decide? 
- **[Unpoll](https://github.com/EnCiv/unpoll)**- How do 1000’s of voters collaborate democratically on what few questions to ask the candidate? (Or their elected representatives).
- **[Civil-server](https://github.com/EnCiv/civil-server)**- How do Civic Tech Projects work together the common stuff (User Login, ID, and management) so they can focus on their core

## Why
### Social Media is like a mob
### Web app where we engage productively in democracy online
